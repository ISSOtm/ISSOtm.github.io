Is it a CTF? Is it a ROM hack? No, it's both! It's Fools2019!

YouTuber and fellow glitch researcher [TheZZAZZGlitch](https://youtube.com/user/TheZZAZZGlitch) has had a tradition since 2016 to make special events for April Fools, revolving around small challenges focused on knowledge of the Pok&eacute;mon series, especially of the games' glitches. This year built off previous year's idea, but worked differently -- instead of constantly hooking the Game Boy to the Internet and downloading data from there, there are instead several self-contained "kingdoms", which you can traverse freely, only needing to "save" (the process works a little bit differently) when changing kingdoms.

*Background: last year had a large amount of requests putting ZZAZZ's server on its knees due to the frequent data downloads (<q>I already have some crazy ideas / the real problem is, my fanbase is growing / a $5 VPS for an online event does not suffice anymore / so whatever I make next will probably be offline</q>). This is also why rate limiting was much more ominous.*

Each year, achievements are included as small extra challenges, but also some achievements are especially tuned towards hackers and expert glitchers. It's also a tradition that some people who completed these challenges write up on how they did it.
