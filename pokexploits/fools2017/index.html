			<h1>Taking The April Fools Very Seriously</h1>
			<p class="lead">
				"Hey dude, there's been a nice challenge released for April Fools ! It's based off hacking Pokémon Blue, and it's super cool !"
				<br />
				"That's all ?"
				<br />
				"No ! When you finish, it gives you a code you enter at <a href="https://zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2017/">zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2017/</a> and it registers a score !!"
				<br />
				"Ooh, nice !"
				<br />
				"There's even achievements, one of them supposedly <q>cannot be obtained through normal means</q>.
				<br />
				<br />
				Normal reaction :
				<br />
				"Wow dude, let's play this !"
				<br />
				<br />
				Better reaction :
				<br />
				"Okay. LET'S GET THIS ACHIEVEMENT."
				<br />
				(Spoiler : I had the second)
			</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h2>Trivia</h2>
			<p><small>Skip this if you want. It's just some context.</small></p>
			<p>
				We all in the Pok&eacute;mon glitching community have a tradition on April the 1st.
				<br />
				At least the three "major" YouTubers in the community : TheZZAZZGlitch, Torchickens / ChickasaurusGL, and Crystal_
				<br />
				<small>The first one that says "Verlisify" gets instant death. All others too.</small>
				<br />
				<br />
				Crystal_ recorded on their GBA Gold being called by Rick Astley who performed a song never heard before.
				<br />
				The April Fools was that it obviously was Youngster Joey.
				<br />
				<br />
				Torchickens presented a video of a cool beta secret, namely an access to the famed Could City (yup).
				<br />
				This time the joke was that it was an alpha secret. Or maybe gamma, I'm not sure.
				<br />
				<br />
				TheZZAZZGlitch found a way to cure cancer, make pizza and coffee, using Pokémon Blue ACE. He offered a download link to the save file if we wanted to try this ourselves.
				<br />
				However Missingno. wanted revenge from his defeat last year, and inserted himself into the save file.
				<br />
				Sorry to all cancerous people, we have lost a way to cure you all. Blame Missingno.
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<p>
				The game is a fully normal Pok&eacute;mon Blue. Then what's the deal ? It's the save file.
				<br />
				As soon as you load it, you are unable to move, and Missingno. (I suppose) welcomes us... and corrupts the map to block us !
			</p>
			<p>
				The challenge is to use cheating to complete the game. You have to ; there's really no way to complete the game legit.
				<br />
				At the end of the game, you are given a password that you place here : <a href="https://zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2017">zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2017/</a>.
				<br />
				This saves your completion time as well as a few achievements. This also allows you to enter a small message that will be displayed in the results video (not published yet).
				<br />
				The page is a leaderboard, that lists the 50 best scores. All other scores are saved but not displayed.
			</p>
			
			<h2>A few details :</h2>
			<p>
				Achievements are kept between playthroughs, meaning it's possible to play slowly and get achievements, and then play fast but don't care about achievements.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game has an anti-timer cheating protection. Obviously you can bypass it.
				<br />
				I didn't reverse engineer the timer code, but it appeared that the in-game time at the end of the Hall of Fame sequence doesn't always match up with the run's time.
				<br />
				My best guess is that the timer keeps running a bit after the HoF sequence starts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, it isn't possible to use the same code twice. We will see how to bypass this later.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Getting scores</h2>
			<p>This section focuses on getting points, by first getting achievements, and then completing the game as fast as possible.</p>
			<p>I recommend using the emulator BGB for its powerful debugging utilities. It helps for most of the stuff listed here, but I agree that it's not user-friendly the first time you see it.</p>
			
			<h3>First playthrough</h3>
			<p>This section's goal is simply to complete the game using the most "intended" path.</p>
			<p>The first room is easy to traverse ; Missingno. hints you at using a WTW cheat. REALLY easy one, bub.</p>
			<p>
				The second room can be traversed by setting your money to 999999 (the cheat is also famous) and talking to the guard.
				<br />You then need to use the item RIVAL's while facing down, go through the blockade while invisible, and then open your Pokemon menu. Then walk.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next is real easy. Talk to Bruno, set Missingno.'s HP to zero, set the opponent's speed to something low (or just attack, he seems to miss a lot), and use Splash. Pow, ded.
				<br />
				Some friends told me they used the "run away" cheat. That also works, but "top percentage" cannot be unlocked if you run away.
			</p>
			<p>Get 4F from Bruno, and go to the next room. You have to alternate the second entry between both values and move around. Note that if you complete the puzzle without pressing up, that's a free achievement.</p>
			<p>The next room, just give yourself a Chansey (look up the <a href="http://gitchcity.info/wiki/The_Big_HEX_List">Big HEX List</a> for the argument). Done !</p>
			<p>The last room's puzzle is the simplest : use ClearSAV through 4F. Watch the Hall of Fame sequence and grab your code !</p>
			
			<h3>Achievements</h3>
			<h4>I'm good on my own</h4>
			<p>This one is one of the easiest. All you have to do is exit the second room without using any items. There are many ways to do this, one of them is in the "speedrunning" section.</p>
			<h4>Top percentage</h4>
			<p>This one is probably the easiest of all. Giving your Magikarp 255 EXP before the Bruno fight (or actually before fainting the opposing Missingno.). It should level up to level 10. Don't thank me, no need.</p>
			<h4>0x Up Presses</h4>
			<p>In the room where you have to change the map with 4F, just never press Up except in menus. It's really easy to do, and again, the speedrunning section's path doesn't require up.</p>
			<h4>Guard skip</h4>
			<p>Same, see the speedrunning part.</p>
			<h4>Pok&eacute;dex flags are weird</h4>
			<p>
				The easiest way to get this one is to mark a Pokemon as seen but not owned.
				<br />
				This achivement has programmed a bit lazily, and all that's really required is to have a different number of owned and seen Pokemon.
				<br />
				An easy way to get it is to GivePokemon with ID 00. It will mark Cubone as seen, but no Pokemon as caught.
			</p>
			<h4>Gullible</h4>
			<p>I didn't get how this one is performed yet. All I know is that in the dark room, you just need to </p>
			<h4>31337</h4>
			<p>See the detailed part below</p>
			
			<h3>Gotta go fast !</h3>
			<p>Coming soon.</p>
