			<h3>Changelog</h3>
			<table class="table">
				<tr class="bg-warning"><td>*</td><td>Heavy rewriting and smaller tweaks to the graphical engine, with the accompanying FPS gains ! Apparently this divided the rendering overload by 2 !</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-warning"><td>*</td><td>The exterior plains and house have been extended horizontally to test camera scrolling.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-warning"><td>*</td><td>The door animation has been changed... multiple times, including fixing graphical oddities.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>A failsafe for invalid items has been added ; and because I love Pok&eacute;mon glitches, it's called "MISSINGITEM.".</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>It also has custom behaviour and description.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>!</td><td>Note that it doesn't exist, but is more of a collection of failsafes that prevent invalid behaviour from happening :)</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td><strong>Adding</strong> a fighting engine.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>The second item of this game's : a <em>Zap Toy</em> !</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-warning"><td>*</td><td>The "DESCRIBE" option has been replaced with a description appearing below the player's inventory.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>Instead is a nice "TOSS" option !</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-warning"><td>*</td><td>Sprites and map layers aren't all loaded in memory at game startup, instead they are stored in external files and read as needed during map loading.<br/>The external files are binary files generated from text files using a program ; the compilation is done by "make layers" and "make sprites" !</td></tr>
				<tr><td>!</td><td>As a result, disk space and RAM usage were reduced. Oh, and loading times are pretty much invisible - and I don't have a SSD.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-primary"><td>~</td><td>The player doesn't appear anymore on the crash screen.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>Alt+F4 / closing the window were changed to instantly shut the game down, but using Escape instead plays a small animation.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>Save points let you return to the title screen, even if you don't choose to save.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>Some command line arguments are supported by the game : -d enables debug info, and -g disables graphical acceleration.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>New debug info : colored bars display the overload (measured in CPU clock cycles) of different game components.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>Due to better knowledge of optimizations provided by GCC, code has been globally optimized.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-primary"><td>~</td><td>Obtaining an item blanked the description of the inventory's CANCEL button. This has been patched.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-warning"><td>*</td><td>The item debugging menu has been improved.</td></tr>
				<tr class="bg-success"><td>+</td><td>Menus opening and closing now have an animation.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>!</td><td>I've noticed a bug sometimes occurs with the "options" command, where the cursor doesn't become white after an option has been selected. I don't know why this occurs.</td></tr>
