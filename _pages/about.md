*Bonsoir.* I am a french male student, age 20, currently studying computing science.

I'm very much into programming, spending a lot of time on my computer developing all sorts of tools. When it comes to computers, I'm hardworking! Especially programming. I've gained quite a lot of knowledge in , though I know that I have much to discover.

I would like to work in computer security, mostly. I have some informal experience, and am directing my studies towards infosec. I have yet to work in an enterprise context, but I am really looking forward to that, maybe an internship?

I'm fluent in French, since that's my mother tongue, but I'm also good at English, as you can hopefully witness. I also learned German, though I'm not that good at it, and am currently studying Japanese.
