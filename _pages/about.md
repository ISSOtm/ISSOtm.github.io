<p itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person">
	<i>Bonsoir.</i> I'm <span itemprop="givenName">Eldred</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Habert</span>, 🇫🇷, <span itemprop="gender" value="male">👨‍🎓</span>, <span itemprop="birthDate" content="1998">21 years old</span>, and currently on my last year of studying computer science. I love programming, security, and retro consoles. Online, I usually go by the nickname "ISSOtm".

## Contact

You may e-mail me at <code>me@&lt;firstName&gt;.fr</code>, replacing <code>&lt;firstName&gt;</code> with my first name... which is also this website's domain name. (Simple anti-spam measure, I hope you understand.)

[I also tweet](https://twitter.com/issotm) from time to time. If you like programmer humor and Game Boy-related tweets, you should find yourself at home :)

## Myself

I am very much into programming, spending a lot of time developing all sorts of tools. My favorite programming languages are C, C++, and Rust—so, mostly systems programming, though as you are seeing, I have proficiencies in other domains, such as the Web.

You can find my résumé in English [here 🇬🇧](/cv/en) ([PDF](/cv/en.pdf)), and *en français* [ici 🇫🇷](/cv/fr) ([PDF](/cv/fr.pdf)).

I would like to work in computer security, directing my studies towards infosec; but I would also be interested in programming, especially at a low level. **I am currently looking for an end-of-studies internship (6 months, starting around April 1st)**.

If you're curious about some of the work I've made, the effort I am currently spending the most time into is [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io) (I also made that website!). You can also check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ISSOtm) for more of my work!

My mother tongue may be French, but I practice English on a daily basis, chatting with active English-speaking communities (mainly [GBDev](https://gbdev.io)). The quality of the English in this web site should be representative of my written and oral skills. I have also studied German until high school, but haven't had a chance to practice it since then. Finally, I am currently learning the basics of Japanese.
