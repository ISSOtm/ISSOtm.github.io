*Bonsoir.* I am a french male student, age 20, currently studying computing science.

I'm very much into programming, spending a lot of time on my computer developing all sorts of tools. When it comes to computers, I'm hardworking, even if I end up sleeping on my keyboard! I've also gained quite a lot of knowledge, though I know that I have much to discover.

I would like to work in computer security, mostly. I have some informal experience, and am directing my studies towards infosec. I have yet to work in an enterprise context, but I am really looking forward to that, maybe an internship?
