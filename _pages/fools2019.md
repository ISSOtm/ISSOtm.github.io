Here's a list of the writeups I made for the 2019 edition of TheZZAZZGlitch's April Fools event. For more information about the event, [this](/projects/fools2019) is the way to go.

Before the list of what I have to say, here is a list of credits where credit is due, in no particular order: TheZZAZZGlitch, [pfero](https://github.com/mid-kid), [Darkshadows](https://twitter.com/darkshadows9776), Runea, [Stranck](https://twitter.com/LStranck), [Ganix](https://github.com/KernelEquinox), [Riley/RoL](https://twitter.com/TheWack0lian).
